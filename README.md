# THE Database to Track Your Employees

## Description

I was motivated to create this Command Line application with Node.JS to further my knowledge and become more comfortable with working in the command line with Node. I built this app as a very intuitive and easy way to keep track of employees and departments within a company. The code within the app updates the tables as new data is entered or removed. It makes keeping track of an organization a lot easier and more efficient. I got to work with MySQL2 a ton and make my own queries in order for the tables to talk to each other and that was a big learning experience for me.

## Installation

The steps to install my project are as follows:

- Clone or fork my code from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies (Inquirer, Console.Table, MySQL2)
- Source the Schema.sql file and then the Seeds.sql file
- Run the file from the command line using "npm start"

## Usage

Here is a link to a video of the file running:
